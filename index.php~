<form action="generate.php">
    <select id="opt1" name="opt1">

  </form>

  <p>
We have a series of PDF forms that currently are filled in manually by a person.
<br/><br/>
We are in the process of creating a MySQL database which will hold all the data used to print these same forms from our MySQL database. That database input project is being done by another contractor.
<br/><br/>
So you will not be creating anything to enter data, the data will already be there in MySQL.
<br/><br/>
We are not interested in a simple fillable PDF for a person to open and fill in, we are capturing the data another way.
<br/><br/>
What we want is to have a person request that a given form be printed for a particular customer and have the entire final report generated from the data in our MySQL database for that customer and test.
<br/><br/>
PDF output is preferable, but alternatively we will consider excel format output.
